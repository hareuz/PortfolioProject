This project is in the financal analysis domain. The analysis shows us the insider trading data of the lsited companies. Insider trading is an important because it results in fluctuation in the stock prices. People, like CEO, COO, owners who own 10 percent or more of the stock, etc. have more insider information about the company and market than the normal person. 

When an insider executes a transaction, he or she must file a Form 4. With this form filing, the public is made aware of the insider's various transactions in company securities, including the amount purchased or sold and the price per share. This data is avaiable on websites (trading data.)

This program, written in Python, is dedicated to Insider Trading that aggregates data from SEC filings. The website "InsiderArbitrage" is used to get Insider trading data for both types of transactions, buying and selling. I wrote a script to scrape real-time data from the website. This script automated and runs on a schedule on my PC daily and gets the data from the website. 

Another website "TradingView.com" is also scraped to get a list of thousands of companies' tickers (their symbols) and the industries/sectors they belong to.  

I also built tablaeu dashboard that is connected to the csv files created by the python script. The csv files are updated regularly automatically and the data is tablaeu is also updated. The dashboard can be found on my tablaeu profile:
